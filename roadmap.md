# 📅 Data Odyssey – 3-Month Learning Roadmap

This roadmap documents a structured 12-week journey through data analysis, statistics, visualization, and machine learning.  
Each phase includes hands-on projects, Python–SQL integration, and bilingual notes for deeper understanding.

---

## 🔹 Month 1: Statistical Foundations + Tool Review

### Week 1–2: Python, Pandas, NumPy + Basic Statistics

- ✅ Practice with small datasets (e.g., student scores, app metrics)
- ✅ Calculate mean, median, variance, standard deviation
- ✅ Compare results using Pandas, NumPy, SQL, and manual formulas
- ✅ Visualize distributions with histograms

### Week 3–4: Statistical Distributions + Hypothesis Testing

- ✅ Learn Normal, Binomial, Poisson distributions
- ✅ Apply t-test, chi-square test
- ✅ Practice with `scipy.stats` and `statsmodels`
- ✅ Document statistical assumptions and interpretations

---

## 🔹 Month 2: Visualization + Mini Projects

### Week 5–6: Matplotlib & Seaborn

- ✅ Create distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, time series trends
- ✅ Use real datasets (e.g., Titanic, Iris)
- ✅ Compare visual styles and readability

### Week 7–8: Plotly + Dashboards

- ✅ Build interactive charts with Plotly
- ✅ Explore Power BI or Tableau basics
- ✅ Mini project: Sales analysis or weather data dashboard

---

## 🔹 Month 3: Machine Learning Basics + Capstone Project

### Week 9–10: Intro to ML Models

- ✅ Learn Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
- ✅ Understand overfitting, cross-validation, feature engineering
- ✅ Practice with `scikit-learn` on clean datasets

### Week 11–12: Full Data Analysis Pipeline

- ✅ End-to-end project: Data cleaning → Statistical analysis → Visualization → Modeling → Reporting
- ✅ Write bilingual README and technical documentation
- ✅ Prepare for portfolio and job applications
